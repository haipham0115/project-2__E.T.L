# project-2__E.T.L
Project 2 with main focus on Extract, Transform and Load (ETL)


Collecting data of a pre-determine area (within 50 miles of LA)
Data of each restaurant would have the main courses that they are famous/well-known for.
What if you don't want to go the restaurant? You just want to learn to cook a dish, or you want some "challenge" to compare your skills with the chefs

The project then use those collected well-known courses and look for detailed recipes
Users ,then, can look up which restaurant, which course and find the recipes that they can try to cook for themselves
